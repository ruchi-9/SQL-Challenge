## Business Task
Danny wants to expand his new Pizza Empire so he had one genius idea to combine with it, he was going to Uberize it and, so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
### Table: customer_orders

The below `customer_orders` given, we can see that there are
- In the exclusions column, there are blank spaces ' ' and null values.
- In the extras column, there are blank spaces ' ' and null values.
  
We need to clean the table:
- Create a temporary table with all the columns
- Remove null values in `exlusions` and `extras` columns and replace with blank space ' '.

````sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  customer_id, 
  pizza_id, 
  CASE
	  WHEN exclusions IS null OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
	  ELSE exclusions
	  END AS exclusions,
  CASE
	  WHEN extras IS NULL or extras LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
	  ELSE extras
	  END AS extras,
	order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;

### Table: runner_orders

Our course of action to clean the  `runner_orders` table below:
- In `pickup_time` column, remove nulls and replace with blank space ' '.
- In `distance` column, remove "km" and nulls and replace with blank space ' '.
- In `duration` column, remove "minutes", "minute" and nulls and replace with blank space ' '.
- In `cancellation` column, remove NULL and null and and replace with blank space ' '.
